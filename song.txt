Well I been told by some people
and they all say to take you back
take you back like a bore.
I don't call this a reason,
I just call it believin in myself.

Well push me back,
you're pushin me too far,
I love you for what I saw before,
I speak to you and I've held you,
but I could not tell you I love you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

Well you put me down,
you put me down real nice,
this love affair is takin the largest slice from my life
as I see it startin out
gonna have more
me and girl
if I just take you back
If I just push you back
If I just love you back.
