Well I been told by some people
and they all say to take you back
take you back like a bore.
I don't call this a reason,
I just call it believin in myself.

Well push me back,
you're pushin me too far,
I love you for what I saw before,
I speak to you and I've held you,
but I could not tell you I love you, you, you, you, you, you, you.
